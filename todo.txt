Todo:
1. Save button (save all new x and y positions)
2. Cancel/exit button (dont save the latest changes)
3. Reset button (reset all defaults)
- Maybe put "Editing UI" text in top left with options to save/edit there?

- Fix drag to coincide with mouse actual drag, its dragging elements more than the mouse rn
- Fix hitboxes for chat and hotbar and everything else
- Add a little box with info showing all values of x and y and currently dragging element.
- Add clamp to avoid moving UI out of screen (like DL).
- Add stick to make it stick to the walls of the screen (like DL).

Obviously:
- Add hooks for everything else UI like resource bars, inventory, OTHER MODS, etc.

Also:
- Make checkboxes for moving only X or only Y direction or both

All other UI:
Inventory not open:
- Life bars
- Map 
- Mana bars
Maybe thats enough, i dont really see the use for moving much else.
Just focus on fixing it for other mods like calamity.

Not compatible with betterchatbox :)

- Maybe make a copy of the UIScale slider when in edit mode?
